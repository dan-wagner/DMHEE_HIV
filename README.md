# DMHEE_HIV

The goal of this repo is to develop and execute the HIV model from the DMHEE 
textbook in a reproducible manner [^1]. This necessitated the creation of an 
automated workflow which was designed to capture the procedures of the 
economic evaluation as well as those used to estimate the parameter inputs 
[^scope]. 

This project was initiated in response to the fact that the original 
textbook exercises are designed and organized for a spreadsheet environment. 
Adapting these exercises to a programming language offered the ability to show 
how this model could be developed in a reproducible fashion. A collection of 
previously identified strategies for reproducibility were used to achieve a 
level of reproducibility that would allow for the reliable re-generation of 
results, including intermediate data sets.

# Project Organization
This project is organized using a consistent directory structure which could be 
applied to most projects. Additionally, it allows for the use of relative file 
paths within scripts - which is essential for portability. An outline of the 
directory structure is presented below. 

```
PROJECT-DIRECTORY
|-data\
|   |-data-raw\
|   |-data-gen\
|     |-Model-Params\
|     |-Simulation-Output\
|-docs\
|-results\
|-src\
|   |-FUNS\
|   |-01_Simulations
|   |-02_Analysis
```

`data`
  : The data directory is used to store both raw (`data-raw`) and generated 
  (`data-gen`) data set. In the latter category, additional sub-directories are 
  used to distinguish between Model Parameters and Simulation Output. 
  
`docs`
  : The docs directory is used to store documents relevant to the project. This 
  may include project-specific [documentation](#documentation), diagrams, or 
  even manuscripts and reports. 
  
`results`
  : The results directory is used to store results from the project. In this 
  case a result is conceptualized as output which is ready to be placed in a 
  manuscript or report. This may include a formatted display table or different 
  kinds of plots produced for the project. 
  
`src`
  : The src is used to store all of the scripts for a project. It is organized 
  into three specific sub-directories. The first sub-directory, `FUNS`, is used 
  to store *functions* which are specific to the project in general. This is 
  where all of the functions used to define the decision model and prepare its 
  parameter inputs are stored. The second sub-directory, `01_Simulations`, is 
  used to store *scripts* which execute all relevant simulations for this 
  project. The third sub-directory, `02_Analysis`, is used to store *scripts* 
  which perform the relevant steps to produce a specific result. In other words, 
  these scripts accept simulation output as input and return a result (i.e. 
  tabular or graphical) which will be stored in the `results` directory.  

# Notes
  * :information_source: Added function to plot Cost-Effectiveness plane.
    - Potential to limit code duplication. Instead uses features of input data 
    to determine how to plot the plane. Right now, that's limited to whether the 
    input data reflects output from deterministic or stochastic model 
    evaluation.
    - Future updates will also include features to accommodate more than two 
    alternatives, and multiple sub-groups. 
    - Plan will be to add this function to my `HEEToolkit` package. 
  * :information_source: Added function to plot Cost-Effectiveness 
  Acceptability Curve. 
    - CEACs are a requirement across projects. Opportunity to eliminate code 
    duplication. 
    - Future updates will accommodate data which contain costs/effects for 
    multiple sub-groups. 
    - Plan will be to add this function to my `HEEToolkit` package.

[^scope]: The functions included in this repo are restricted to the development 
of the HIV model itself. Given that consistent analytic frameworks must be 
applied to all decision models, a separate R package was developed to 
promote re-usability and save future development time. This package is not yet 
publicly available.  
[^tmat]: The function to define the transition matrix is executed within the 
call stack when drawing parameters. This design choice was simply due to the 
nature of the input data. In other circumstances, like the THR model, this 
function will be incorpored within the model call stack instead.
