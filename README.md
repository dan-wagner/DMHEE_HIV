The goal of this repo is to develop and execute the HIV model from DMHEE. Instructions from textbook are organized around spreadsheet development. Different approach and sequence needed when using a programming language like R.

## Progress

-   Develop Model

    -   Capability for deterministic and probabilistic evaluation.

-   Simulations: Adoption Decision

    -   Base Case: Female, Age 60

    -   Sub-groups:

        -   Male: Age 40, 60, 80

        -   Female: Age 40, 60, 80

-   Analyze Simulation Results

    -   Deterministic Results Table

    -   Probabilistic
